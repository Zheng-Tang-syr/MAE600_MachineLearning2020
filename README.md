# MAE600_MachineLearning2020
Term project of MAE600

This project uses weather data (Pressure,Temperature, RH, Dew Point, Solar Radiation, Wind Speed, Gust Speed, Wind Direction) to predict energy consumption of a building, 
using a 3-layer-neural-network (3_Layer_nn.py). 

And RNN, LSTM and GRU is used to predict future energy consumption using previous data.
